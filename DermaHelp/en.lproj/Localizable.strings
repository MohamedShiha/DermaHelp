"Actinic keratoses heading" = "Actinic Keratosis";
"Actinic keratoses awareness" = "- Actinic keratosis is not cancerous, but rather a precancerous condition, and usually benign.
- Only 10 percent of these spots will eventually become cancerous.
- If not treated in a timely manner, actinic keratosis can turn into squamous cell carcinoma, which can metastasize and spread to other areas of the body.";

"Basal cell carcinoma heading" = "Basal Cell Carcinoma";
"Basal cell carcinoma awareness" = "- Basal cell carcinoma is mostly a benign form of skin cancer.
- Therapies that are currently used for basal cell carcinoma offer an 85 to 95 percent recurrence-free cure rate.
- Most are curable and cause minimal damage when caught and treated early.";

"Benign keratosis-like lesion heading" = "Benign Keratosis-Like Lesions";
"Benign keratosis-like lesion awareness" = "- Benign keratosis (also called seborrheic keratosis) are noncancerous (benign) skin growths.
- Following the first treatment, complete healing was detected in 68-100% of the lesions.
- Seborrheic keratosis can be unsightly, but the growths aren't harmful.";

"Dermatofibroma heading" = "Dermatofibroma";
"Dermatofibroma awareness" = "- Dermatofibromas are noncancerous (benign) skin growths that can develop anywhere on the body but most often appear on the lower legs, upper arms or upper back.
- As they are harmless and do not turn into cancer, no treatment is usually needed.
- Dermatofibromas do not go away by themselves, but they can be removed under local anaesthetic if there is doubt about their diagnosis.";

"Melanocytic nevus heading" = "Melanocytic Nevus";
"Melanocytic nevus awareness" = "- If diagnosed properly, melanocytic nevi are biologically stable, completely benign lesions.
-Patients with multiple melanocytic nevi or sizable ones appear to have an increased lifetime risk of melanoma.
- Melanocytic nevi can be surgically removed for cosmetic considerations or because of concern regarding the potential of melanoma.";

"Melanoma heading" = "Melanoma";
"Melanoma awareness" = "- Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. It may appear as a new spot or as a change in an existing mole or freckle.
- Over 95 per cent of skin cancers can be successfully treated if they are found early.
- Once melanoma has spread deeper into the skin or other parts of the body, it becomes more difficult to treat and can be deadly.";

"Vascular lesion heading" = "Vascular Lesions";
"Vascular lesion awareness" = "- Vascular tumors may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer) and can occur anywhere in the body.
- For example, angioma is a benign tumor made up of blood vessels, whereas angiosarcoma is a cancerous growth of the same cells, but is malignant.
- Infantile hemangiomas are the most common type of vascular lesion, They are benign tumors of the cells that line blood vessels.";
